            What is event loop? How does it work?
          </h2>
          <div

            <p>
              There is some javascript code hanging out with your favorite code
              editor. We know by this point that JS Engine and the call stack
              are the primary things responsible for running the javascript
              code. In order for the code to be executed, it has to be brought
              on the call stack for JS Engine to execute it. Now recall the
              callback function in the example above. Last we heard of it was
              when it was in some fancy new memory unit called the callback
              queue. After 10 seconds have passed, it has to be executed. Event
              loop in JavaScript is such a mechanism which handles this. This
              means it manages the lifecycle of a callback function from the
              callback queue to the call stack. Whenever you read about the
              event loop in javascript next, think of it as a mechanism more
              than anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              But How does it work? Let's begin by stating the universal truth -
              “A call stack will have to be empty for the event loop to bring
              anything in it”. Whenever the call stack is empty, the first
              entered unit in the callback queue is brought to the call stack by
              the event loop which was observing both the call stack and
              callback queue. Did You Notice? setTimeout of an 'n' seconds does
              not guarantee execution exactly when 'n' seconds have passed,
              rather it guarantees a minimum delay of 'n'. This is because after
              a defined limit, the callback function moves to the callback queue
              (stating ready for execution) where the event loop is supposed to
              pick it for actual execution. A very interesting piece of
              information event loop in javascript is an event loop does not
              block. Operations that might potentially require waiting are
              performed using callbacks and events.
