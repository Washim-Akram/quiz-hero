            JavaScript map(), forEach(), filter() and find() methods are
            iterable methods for iterate JS array element.Using these methods,
            we are able to iterate an array, array of objects etc. and get the
            specific value. In the se methods some are return an array and some
            are return undefined. But these all methods are not change the
            original array. In following, we are discuss the differences between
            map, forEach, filter and find array methods in JavaScript.

            What is event loop? How does it work?

              JavaScript is JIT Compiled, Multi-Paradigm, prototyped-based
              Programming Language. JavaScript is "Single Threaded" and
              synchronous Programming Language by nature. Single Threaded means
              only one statement is executed at a time. JavaScript only has one
              call stack. JavaScript runs code line by line. Must finish
              executing a piece of code before moving onto the next.
              <br />
              But also JavaScript Smoothly handled asynchronous behaviour and
              workflow. JavaScript has a mechanism that handled asynchronous
              workflow and callback function and stack and queue is called event
              loop. Its a Js model and mechanism to handle executing the code,
              processing events and handle and executing the callback
              functions(stack and queue).
            </p>
            <p>
              When there are tasks in the call stack, they are going to be
              executed and therefore the call stack is empty. when the call
              stack is empty, the event loop is going to check if there is any
              task in the queue(event queue, scheduled queue, microtask queue).
              If there is a task in the event queue, the event loop pass the
              task. if there is not a task in the event queue, the event loop is
              going to see on the scheduled queue, if there's a task scheduled,
              the event loop will pass that task. then, it's going to see if
              there's a task in the microtask queue, if there's a task, the
              event loop will pass the task.

                There is some javascript code hanging out with your favorite
                code editor. We know by this point that JS Engine and the call
                stack are the primary things responsible for running the
                javascript code. In order for the code to be executed, it has to
                be brought on the call stack for JS Engine to execute it. Now
                recall the callback function in the example above. Last we heard
                of it was when it was in some fancy new memory unit called the
                callback queue. After 10 seconds have passed, it has to be
                executed. Event loop in JavaScript is such a mechanism which
                handles this. This means it manages the lifecycle of a callback
                function from the callback queue to the call stack. Whenever you
                read about the event loop in javascript next, think of it as a
                mechanism more than anything else.
